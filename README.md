## Practice Target
Practice Target for Software Carpentries GitHub Workshop

=======
We will practise creating issues on github! This is the same function shown with screenshots in [checkout instructions for lesson contribution](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout#what-is-an-issue-github-101).

➡️ **Create an issue** to change the `apple` you are assigned to `banana`.

For example, your issue might read: `change apple0 to banana0`.

Jay: apple1

Simon: apple2

Wendy: apple3

Meaghan: apple4

Fatemeh: banana5

Sophie: apple6

Victoria: apple7

Cindy: apple8
